/**
 * OBJECTS
 *
 * In objects, we’re really talking about design patterns like the media object.
 * This is the first layer where you’d begin to use classes. Here you’d want to
 * choose agnostic names that aren’t specific to the type of object. For example,
 * you may have a .slider-list, but not a .product-slider-list. The idea is to
 * keep these cosmetic-free in order to keep them reusable across component
 * instances.
